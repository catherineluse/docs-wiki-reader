Howdy buckaroos! Use this section of the docs to jump start your deployment and testing of Rancher 2.x! It contains instructions for a simple Rancher setup and some common use cases. We plan on adding more content to this section in the future.

We have Quick Start Guides for:

- [Deploying Rancher Server](./quick-start-guide/deployment.md): Get started running Rancher using the method most convenient for you.

- [Deploying Workloads](./quick-start-guide/workload.md): Deploy a simple [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads.md) and expose it, letting you access it from outside the cluster.

- [Using the CLI](./quick-start-guide/cli.md): Use `kubectl` or Rancher command line interface (CLI) to interact with your Rancher instance.
