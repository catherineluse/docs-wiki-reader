Within Rancher, each user has a number of settings associated with their login: personal preferences, API keys, etc. You can configure these settings by choosing from the **User Settings** menu. You can open this menu by clicking your avatar, located within the main menu.

The available user settings are:

- [API & Keys](./user-settings/api-keys.md): If you want to interact with Rancher programmatically, you need an API key. Follow the directions in this section to obtain a key.
